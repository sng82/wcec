            Why did you join the WCEC?

            <p>
                I joined the WCEC because I felt it was a very good environment to be in, surrounded by other people involved in the same industry as myself.

            <p>
                Networking, reputation building, gaining insight into other areas of the industry, and learning from the experience of others at the peak of their careers is what attracted me to the WCEC.

                Ten years ago I started as a window cleaner in London as a means to an end. Within a few years I then
                trained to be a Rope Access Technician to increase my skills and possibilities. I now run a team of
                experienced abseilers and cradle operators capable of carrying out a range of tasks in the commercial
                cleaning, building construction and maintenance industries. Through the years I have developed a passion for
                what I do. I’m proud of what we have done and are accomplishing as a company.

                One benefit in being a member is the privilege to be able to wine and dine in unique settings, such as the
                Mansion House and other grand halls, by invitation only. Also, becoming a Freeman of the City of London and
                Liveryman is a personal achievement that probably would never have been possible without the WCEC. Meeting
                and connecting with like-minded people has gone a long way for me personally, both socially and within
                business.

                a good setting.

                The cleaning industry will continue to shine (excuse the pun!) with the right individuals driving it
                forward. For the 10 years I have been in the industry, it has changed dramatically. The standards keep on
                being raised by hard-working individuals (not only within our company!). The future is looking very sparkly!
