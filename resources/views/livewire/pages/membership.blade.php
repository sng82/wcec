                        On first joining the company you become a Freeman (and can later become a Liveryman) of the
                        Environmental Cleaners. Freedom of the Company is open for persons who are or have been – in the
                        opinion of the Court – engaged in, or closely connected with, the trade of Environmental
                        Cleaning or associated trade or trades or occupations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be made a Freeman of the Company is a significant honour and one which is bestowed only after
                        careful consideration by the Court of Assistants.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Being a Freeman of the City of London remains a unique part of London’s history and many people
                        who have lived or worked in the City have been proud to be admitted as a Freeman. Today most of
                        the practical reasons for obtaining the Freedom of the City have disappeared, but it maintains
                        its desirability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Freedom of the City of London is administered by the Clerk to the Chamberlains’ Court at
                        Guildhall. All Freedom applications (other than those by Patrimony or Servitude) to the
                        Chamberlain’s Court are then approved by the Court of Aldermen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a pre-requisite to becoming a liveryman of any livery company that you must first have
                        become a Freeman of the City. The usual order would be:
                    </p>

                        A liveryman is a freeman of the City of London, who is entitled to wear the livery of the
                        ancient guild or city district to which he belongs and to vote in the election of Lord Mayor,
                        chamberlain, and other municipal and honorary officers.

                            work in the environmental cleaning industries, there is a strong social dimension to the
                            Environmental Cleaners as members get to know their industry colleagues at meetings and
                            functions. Members can also invite family and friends to banquets and other events staged in
                            some of London’s finest and most historic buildings.

                        Historically, prospective new members of the Environmental Cleaners have been introduced by
                        existing Members, as is common in many clubs and societies. Members are encouraged to put
                        forward people from within the industry whom they consider suitable.

                    <p>
                        We have recently introduced three exciting new routes to membership of the Worshipful Company of
                        Environmental Cleaners, which we hope will greatly enhance our growth potential for the future.

                    <p>
                        Allows industry organisations to join as a whole, with 3 delegated individuals from within that
                        organisation joining as Corporate Members for a fixed period of time. The package offers a
                        combination of places at key events as well and PR exposure as well as delivering significant
                        sponsorship funds and charity contributions. It also allows those delegated individuals to begin
                        their own personal journey towards full Livery membership should they so desire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope that Corporate Membership will also promote the Worshipful Company more widely across
                        the UK to attract interest from organisations and individuals outside of the City of London and
                        it’s environs.

                        looking to grow their knowledge of the environmental cleaning sector at the start of their
                        business careers, the Court approved the Pathway Membership grade. Allowing a lower cost entry,
                        designed to deliver a ‘try before you buy’ option, Pathway Members will be individually mentored
                        and guided by the Worshipful Company again with a view to embarking on their own Livery journey
                        within an agreed timeframe.

                        Forces and particularly with its cadets, recognising individuals each year at our Military
                        Awards Luncheon. From this point onwards, winners of Military Awards will be presented with a
                        lifetime membership as part of the awards package. Similarly to the other grades, our award
                        winners will be mentored and guided by the Worshipful Company towards full membership at some
                        stage in the future.
